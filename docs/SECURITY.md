# Security Improvements for Liberty Unleashed Server Directory

This document outlines the security improvements implemented to address Go vulnerability warnings and enhance overall application security.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. File Operations Security
- **Issue**: Unrestricted file operations with `os.OpenFile`, `os.WriteFile`, `os.ReadFile`, and `os.Stat`
- **Solution**: 
  - Added secure file operation functions with path validation
  - Implemented path traversal protection
  - Added file size limits (1MB for config, 100MB for logs)
  - Improved file permissions (0600 for config, 0644 for logs)
  - Added input sanitization for file paths

### 2. HTTP Request Security
- **Issue**: Potential vulnerabilities in HTTP request handling
- **Solution**:
  - Added request size limits (1KB for form data)
  - Implemented rate limiting (60 requests per minute per IP)
  - Added security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
  - Enhanced input validation for all endpoints
  - Added method validation for all endpoints

### 3. Configuration Security
- **Issue**: Insufficient validation of configuration values
- **Solution**:
  - Added comprehensive validation for all config parameters
  - Implemented IP address validation for blacklists and official servers
  - Added validation for environment variable overrides
  - Improved error handling without information disclosure

### 4. Dependency Management
- **Issue**: Missing `go.sum` file for dependency integrity
- **Solution**: Added `go.sum` file through `go mod tidy`

## Security Features Implemented

### File System Security
- **Path Validation**: All file paths are cleaned and validated to prevent directory traversal
- **Size Limits**: Maximum file sizes enforced to prevent disk space exhaustion
- **Permission Control**: Restrictive file permissions to limit access
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log file rotation when size limit is reached

### Network Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Simple in-memory rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all input parameters
- **Security Headers**: HTTP security headers to prevent common attacks
- **Request Size Limits**: Limits on request body size to prevent resource exhaustion

### Configuration Security
- **Environment Variable Validation**: Validation of environment variable values
- **IP Address Validation**: Ensuring only valid IP addresses are processed
- **Port Range Validation**: Restricting port numbers to valid ranges
- **Silent Failure**: Blacklisted IPs receive successful responses but are ignored

## Configuration

### File Permissions
- Config files: `0600` (owner read/write only)
- Log files: `0644` (owner read/write, group/others read only)

### Size Limits
- Config file: 1MB maximum
- Log file: 100MB maximum (with rotation)
- HTTP request body: 1KB maximum

### Rate Limiting
- Maximum 60 requests per minute per IP address
- Sliding window implementation with cleanup

### HTTP Timeouts
- Read timeout: 10 seconds
- Write timeout: 10 seconds  
- Idle timeout: 60 seconds
- Max header bytes: 1MB

## Environment Variables

All environment variables are now validated:
- `LUSD_PORT`: Must be integer between 1-65535
- `LUSD_USER_AGENT`: Must be 1-100 characters, no path traversal
- `LUSD_STALE_TIMEOUT`: Must be valid Go duration format
- `LUSD_LOG_FILE`: Must be valid path, no path traversal, max 255 characters
- `LUSD_LOG_ENABLED`: Must be valid boolean

## Error Handling

- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Detailed logging for debugging while maintaining security
- Graceful degradation when security validation fails

## Monitoring and Logging

- All security events are logged
- Rate limiting violations are tracked
- Invalid input attempts are logged
- File access errors are logged with generic user messages

## Compliance

These improvements address:
- Path traversal vulnerabilities (CWE-22)
- Resource exhaustion attacks (CWE-400)
- Information disclosure (CWE-200)
- Input validation issues (CWE-20)
- Improper access control (CWE-284)

## Recommendations for Production

1. Deploy behind a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) for additional security
2. Implement proper TLS/SSL termination
3. Use a proper logging solution instead of file-based logging
4. Consider implementing persistent rate limiting with Redis
5. Add monitoring and alerting for security events
6. Regular security audits and dependency updates
